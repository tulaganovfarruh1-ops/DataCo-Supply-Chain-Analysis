In-Depth Analysis of the DataCo Smart Supply Chain
Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive exploratory and diagnostic analysis of the "DataCo Smart Supply Chain for Big Data Analysis" dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to move beyond surface-level metrics to uncover the root causes of major business challenges, demonstrating a full cycle of data analysis from data cleaning and transformation to statistical hypothesis testing.

Key Questions Investigated
Sales Performance: How did sales and profit change over time, and what caused a significant sales anomaly?

Operational Efficiency: How reliable is the delivery process, and what are the primary drivers of late shipments?

Customer Value: Who are the most valuable customers, and what risks are associated with the customer base?

Statistical Link: Is there a statistically significant link between poor delivery service and customer value?

Analytical Approach & Key Findings
This project identified two independent, systemic crises within the business: a localized sales collapse and a global logistics failure.

Sales Crisis Investigation:

Finding: A YoY analysis proved that a catastrophic sales decline in late 2017 was a systemic crisis, not seasonality, with sales dropping by up to 67% compared to the previous year.

Root Cause: The crisis was traced to a -100% sales collapse in high-value sports-related categories (Fishing, Cleats, Camping & Hiking) concentrated in specific markets (LATAM, USCA, Africa, Europe).

Logistics Crisis Investigation:

Finding: A staggering 55% of all orders are delivered late, indicating a global, systemic failure in logistics.

Root Cause: The issue was not market-specific but was traced to particular shipping methods. "First Class" and "Second Class" were identified as fundamentally unreliable, with late delivery rates of ~95% and ~77%, respectively.

Customer Base Risk Analysis (RFM & t-test):

Finding: RFM segmentation revealed that 67% of all revenue is generated by a single segment: "At Risk (High Value)" customers who have not purchased recently. The company has zero "Champion" customers.

Statistical Proof: A two-sample t-test was conducted, yielding a p-value of 0. This statistically proves that the company's most valuable customers (highest Monetary value) are the ones who disproportionately experience delivery delays.

Final Conclusion
The analysis concludes that the sales crisis was likely triggered by the global logistics crisis. The company's most valuable customers, concentrated in Western markets, were systematically subjected to poor delivery service, leading to their mass churn in late 2017.
