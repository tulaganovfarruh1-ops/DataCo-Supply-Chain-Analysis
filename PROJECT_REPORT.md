Project Report: A Deep Dive into the DataCo Supply Chain
The Story of Two Crises
This report details a comprehensive analysis of the DataCo Smart Supply Chain dataset. The investigation began as a standard analysis of sales trends but quickly uncovered two independent, systemic crises within the business: a localized sales collapse and a global logistics failure.

The analysis proves that these two crises are linked. The company's most valuable customers—those who generated 67% of all revenue—were systematically subjected to poor delivery service. A two-sample t-test statistically proved (with a p-value of 0) that high-value customers were the ones most likely to experience late deliveries. This poor service likely triggered their mass churn in late 2017, leading to a catastrophic and geographically concentrated sales collapse where sales of key product categories dropped by 100% in the Americas, Africa, and Europe.

This project demonstrates a full cycle of data analysis: from data cleaning and time series analysis to customer segmentation and, finally, statistical hypothesis testing to uncover the hidden story behind the numbers.

Part 1: Uncovering the Sales Anomaly (Time Series Analysis)
The investigation began with an analysis of monthly sales performance. After cleaning and transforming non-standard date fields using SQL string functions, a clear picture emerged.

Key Findings:

Business Stagnation: From 2015 to late 2017, the business was stable but stagnant. A Year-over-Year (YoY) analysis showed growth hovering around 0%, indicating a lack of real market expansion.

The Anomaly: A dramatic sales collapse occurred in late 2017. YoY analysis confirmed this was a systemic crisis, not seasonality, with sales dropping by as much as -67% compared to the prior year.

Drill-Down Analysis:
The investigation then focused on identifying the epicenter of this crisis.

By Category: A normalized analysis (comparing anomaly sales to the historical monthly average) revealed that the collapse was driven by a -100% drop in sales for high-value, sports-related categories like Fishing, Cleats, and Camping & Hiking.

By Market: The crisis was geographically concentrated. Sales in LATAM, USCA, and Africa dropped by -100%, while Europe saw a decline of -89%. Only the Pacific Asia market remained relatively stable.

Part 2: Diagnosing the Logistics Failure (Delivery Performance)
The second phase of the analysis investigated the company's operational efficiency to see if it could explain the sales collapse.

Key Findings:

Global Logistics Crisis: A staggering 55% of all orders are delivered late, pointing to a massive, systemic failure in the company's logistics.

Root Cause Identified: The problem was not market-specific but was traced directly to the Shipping Mode. "First Class" and "Second Class" shipping were found to be fundamentally unreliable, with late delivery rates of ~95% and ~77%, respectively, across all markets.

This finding was critical: while the logistics problem was global, the sales collapse was local. This suggested that customers in Western markets were less tolerant of the poor service.

Part 3: Identifying the Victims (RFM Customer Segmentation)
To understand who was most affected by these issues, a full RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis was conducted to segment the customer base.

Key Findings:

No "Champions": The analysis revealed that the company has zero "Champion" customers (customers who purchase recently, frequently, and spend a lot).

The "At Risk" Core: The most alarming discovery was that 67% of all company revenue is generated by a single segment: "At Risk (High Value)". These are customers who used to purchase frequently and spend a lot but have not made a purchase in a long time. Their low Recency score is a direct reflection of the late 2017 sales crisis.

Part 4: The Smoking Gun (Statistical Proof)
The final step was to statistically prove the connection between the logistics failure and the loss of high-value customers.

Hypothesis: Customers who experience late deliveries have a different monetary value than customers who do not.

Method: A two-sample t-test was conducted in Excel on data prepared with SQL. Customers were divided into two groups: those with at least one late delivery and those with none.

Result: The test yielded a p-value of 0. This provides the strongest possible statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

The Insight: The analysis proved that the company's most valuable customers (average spend of $2,244) are the ones who systematically experience late deliveries, while lower-value customers (average spend of $196) are far more likely to receive their orders on time.

Final Conclusion & Project Summary
This project successfully connected the dots between three separate analyses to tell a single, powerful story. The catastrophic sales crisis of 2017 was not a random market event but the direct result of a global logistics failure that disproportionately affected the company's most valuable customers, leading to their mass churn.

This investigation demonstrates the power of moving beyond surface-level dashboards to conduct deep, multi-faceted analysis, validating findings with statistical rigor to uncover actionable, high-impact insights.
